This is the code repository for [Qt 5 and OpenCV 4 Computer Vision Projects](link), published by Packt.

**Get up to speed with cross-platform computer vision app development by building seven practical projects**

## What is this book about?
We are entering the age of artificial intelligence, and Computer Vision plays an important role in the AI field. This book combines OpenCV 4 and Qt 5 as well as many deep learning models to develop many complete, practical, and functional applications through which the readers can learn a lot in CV, GUI, and AI domains.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Create an image viewer with all the basic requirements
Construct an image editor to filter or transform images
Develop a security app to detect movement and secure homes
Build an app to detect facial landmarks and apply masks to faces
Create an app to extract text from scanned documents and photos
Train and use cascade classifiers and DL models for object detection
Build an app to measure the distance between detected objects
Implement high-speed image filters on GPU with Open Graphics Library (OpenGL)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
QMenu *editMenu;
         QToolBar *editToolBar;
         QAction *blurAction;
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for engineers and developers who are familiar with both Qt and OpenCV frameworks and are capable of creating simple projects using them, but want to build their skills to create professional-level projects using them. Familiarity with the C++ language is a must to follow the example source codes in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-8).
